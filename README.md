# FÜD
The purpose of FÜD is to help you decide where to eat. It accomplishes this by showing the results as a card style selection. The original idea was that it would tell you where to eat and only show one answer, the card style was introduced to still show one result but allow you to pick a new one easily. 
## Implementation
All you have to do is pick the range of restaurants that will show up and FÜD will do the rest. Swipe right to save the restaurant to your favorite restaurant list. Swipe left to go to the next restaurant. To pick a restaurant, simply click on the card and it will open directions to the restaurant.
## How to Build
Simply clone or download the project for the full working version. Finally, add your own Google API Key.
## Requirements
Xcode
Swift 4.0
## License
